# Quantum Salvation Labs

A cutting-edge interactive landing page experience that combines immersive 3D/4D visualization with game-like mechanics to take users on a journey through quantum reality.

## Project Overview

Quantum Salvation Labs transforms Dante's Inferno into a modern quantum-themed journey. Users descend through nine interactive levels, embodying a quantum scientist with special abilities, while exploring concepts of quantum physics and consciousness evolution.

## Key Features

- **Interactive 3D Experience** - Particle effects with custom shaders and WebGL-based quantum visualization
- **Character-Driven Narrative** - Play as a quantum scientist with first/third-person camera modes and WASD + mouse controls
- **Quantum Abilities** - Phase shifting, time dilation fields, molecular reconstruction, and quantum entanglement
- **Progressive Journey** - Nine levels representing quantum consciousness evolution with mission briefings
- **Advanced UI Design** - Glassmorphism aesthetic with responsive particle effects and mobile fallbacks

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with styled-components
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js with React Three Fiber
- **Animation**: GSAP for smooth transitions and effects
- **State Management**: Context API with localStorage persistence

## Technical Features

- Performance optimization with device detection
- WebGL detection with fallback options
- Local storage for game state persistence
- Dynamic particle system with LOD adjustments
- Event-based architecture for extensibility

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser to `localhost:3000`

## Requirements
